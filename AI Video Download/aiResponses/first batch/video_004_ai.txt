Okay, so I need to analyze this transcript and extract up to three highly engaging shareable blocks for social media. The rules are pretty specific, so I should make sure I follow them closely.

First, I'll read through the transcript carefully. It's in Portuguese, so I might need to translate it to understand the content better. The speaker is talking about the political scenario in Minas Gerais, specifically about Dilma Rousseff's drop in the polls for the Senate race. They mention that she was leading but now isn't even in second place, which is surprising. The speaker seems to criticize her past actions, like the 2014 election campaign, and suggests that her not being elected is a good thing because she didn't deliver on her promises.

Now, I need to identify segments that start and end naturally, each being a complete argument. Each should have a setup, key argument, and reflection. They should be around 60-120 seconds when spoken, so not too short. Also, they should be insightful, impactful, or potentially controversial.

Looking at the transcript, the first part talks about Dilma's surprising drop in the polls. That's a clear setup, explanation of the drop, and the implications. That could be a good first segment.

Next, the speaker explains why Dilma's drop is positive, mentioning her 2014 campaign promises and how she didn't deliver. This is another complete argument with a setup, explanation, and reflection on the electorate's decision.

The third part could focus on the electorate's discernment in rejecting Dilma, highlighting their informed decision as a positive sign for democracy. This provides a reflective angle on the situation.

I need to make sure each segment is distinct and doesn't overlap. Also, each should have a clear rationale explaining why it's engaging for social media—maybe because it's surprising, insightful, or controversial.

I should avoid short excerpts and focus on depth. Each segment should be a standalone video clip that captures a full idea. Let me structure each segment with the text and a concise reason for each choice.

**Segment 1:**  
"Quero voltar aqui e perguntar para o professor, cedista político Rubens Figueiredo, sobre esse cenário em Minas Gerais, que sem dúvida nenhuma chamou a atenção com a ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff, que segundo todas as pesquisas anteriores, estava liderando a corrida ao Senado, e agora nem indo com a segunda vaga, aparecendo em terceiro lugar, ou em quarto lugar até. Ou seja, algo absolutamente surpreendente, afinal de contas, segundo todas as pesquisas Dilma ia em primeiro lugar para o Senado, para o Minas Gerais."  
**Reason:** This segment is engaging because it highlights a surprising political shift, capturing attention with its unexpected twist.

**Segment 2:**  
"Algo que chama a atenção nessas últimas pesquisas, porque justamente é uma ex-presidente da República que sofreu o impeachment, mas até então parecia ter um grande eleitorado mineiro. É surpreendente e tranquilizador, porque se o povo mineiro elegesse a ex-presidente Dilma, com tudo que ela fez no país, seria realmente uma demonstração de a mais absoluta falta de relação com os fatos, porque quem procurou se informar sobre o que ela fez, sobre como ela conduziu o Brasil, e ela promoveu um estelionato eleitoral em 2014, porque ela prometeu fartura e entregou a Rocha, chamou o Levi."  
**Reason:** This segment is impactful as it critiques Dilma's past actions, offering a controversial viewpoint that can spark debate.

**Segment 3:**  
"Não foi isso, Jan? Ela prometeu manteca e entregou o Levi para conduzir a política econômica. Então ela atraiu a confiança dos brasileiros, e Minas Gerais teve o bom senso de não eleger ela para o Senado Nacional."  
**Reason:** This segment reflects on the electorate's discernment, providing a positive outlook on democratic choices and informed decision-making.
